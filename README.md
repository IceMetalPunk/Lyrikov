## Lyrikov
### By IceMetalPunk
Lyrikov is a Node.JS app that will let you enter any musical artist's name, and then generate new song lyrics in that artist's style. It uses the power of Markov chains, so you may get some amusing results; I suggest trying it with Red Hot Chili Peppers, since they're pretty much a Markov chain generator as it is :)
